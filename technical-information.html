The institutes will apply for fellowship   through the institute head on  institute letterhead and endorsed by the   head of the neonatology unit /  fellowship program coordinator. The   application will be addressed to the  Chairperson of the chapter. The   institute should be registered with the  local authorities and the   registration number and certificate should be  attached with the   application. </p>
