All applicant institutes will be   physically inspected by a  team of one or two members appointed by the   chapter and the travel and  lodging of these inspectors will be arranged   by the applicant institute.  The institutes will apply for fellowship   through the institute head on  institute letterhead and endorsed by the   head of the neonatology unit /  fellowship program coordinator. The   application will be addressed to the  Chairperson of the chapter. The   institute should be registered with the  local authorities and the   registration number and certificate should be  attached with the   application. </p>
